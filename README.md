# Project1-uxui

## My Project experience:
#### After office hours, I was able to work on it relatively smoothly. I still need practice with flexbot and grid which is why the pictures are not responsive as I would like. Additionally, I had trouble downloading selected fonts and with the lack of time on my end, I just choose regular fonts for the mean time. I learned a lot from this assignment and understood a lot more about CSS than I did before. While not the best, I am very grateful for granting us an extension and will work hard on my other assignments.
